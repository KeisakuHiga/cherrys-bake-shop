        <p>
          Named after our lovely child, <strong>Cherry</strong>, we opened The
          Cherry's Bakeshop and Cafe in 2016. We always had a dream of opening
          our store.
          <pre />
          Mariz used to previously sell cakes and orders from our home. She has
          attained certifications in baking and filipino cuisine. We at Cherry's
          Bakeshop and Cafe pride ourselves on delivering unmatched quality
          cakes since inception.
